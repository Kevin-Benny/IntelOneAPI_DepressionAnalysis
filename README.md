# Depression Analysis

# PROBLEM STATEMENT 

Developing an Efficient Text Prediction Model for Depression Detection using Intel OneAPI. Detecting depression from textual content has become increasingly important for early intervention and support. This problem statement focuses on creating a robust and accurate text prediction model using the Intel OneAPI toolkit to identify signs of depression within written text.  And approach and assist people to help them.

# CAUSE 
Depression is a widespread mental health concern that affects millions of people globally. Timely detection and intervention are pivotal for effective treatment and support. Traditional methods of diagnosing depression often rely on self-reporting, which might not be accurate due to stigma or lack of awareness. Hence, there's a pressing need for non-invasive, scalable, and accurate tools that can identify individuals at risk of depression based on their language patterns.
